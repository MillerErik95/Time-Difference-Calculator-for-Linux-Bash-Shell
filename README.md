This project is a C++ program designed to run in a Linux Bash shell, allowing users to calculate the time difference between the current date and a user-specified target date. 
The program sets the timezone to Los Angeles (PST/PDT) and adjusts the current time accordingly. 
It prompts the user to input a target date in MM/DD/YYYY format, calculates the difference in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and verifies the correctness of the total number of seconds. 
The program demonstrates efficient handling of date and time operations in C++, user input processing, and basic validation techniques. 
Ideal for users needing a simple, command-line tool to compute time intervals for scheduling and planning purposes.
